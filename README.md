PUI A4: JS Shopping Cart
========

This repository is a basic site of four base html pages, css, and a shopping cart.

## Some things I learned, some trouble points

* It gets messy mizing jQuery and JS sometimes.
* Reusable functions are your friends.
* Things just look different in different browsers.
* jQuery is way shorter and easier.
* I totally see why there are a million JS libraries today after writing all this myself.

That's it. Thanks, Scott
