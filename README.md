PUI A4: JS Shopping Cart
========

This repository is a basic site of four base html pages, css, and a shopping cart.

## Some things I learned, some trouble points

* It gets messy combining jQuery and JS sometimes. e.g. using jQuery selectors in a pure JS function and vice versa
* Reusable functions are your friends.
* Things just look different in different browsers, mainly CSS.
* jQuery is way shorter and easier, use when you can.
* I totally see why there are a million JS libraries today after writing all this myself.
* I'm glad I feel more comfortable using JS now :)


That's it. Thanks, Scott
